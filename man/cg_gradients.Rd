\title{Calculate Gradients}
\usage{
cg_gradients(graph, target, values = new.env(parent = emptyenv()),
  index = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{cg_graph object, graph that is differentiated.}

\item{target}{cg_node object, node in the graph that is differentiated.}

\item{values}{named list or environment, values that are subsituted for the nodes in the graph.}

\item{index}{numeric scalar, index of the target node that is differentiated. Defaults to the first element.}
}
\value{
environment, the gradients of all ancestors of the node (including the target node itself) with respect to the target node.
}
\description{
Differentiate the graph with respect to a node by reverse automatic differentiation.
}
\note{
All nodes required to compute the node must have a value, or their value must be able to be computed at run-time. The values of nodes can be obtained by first evaluating function \link[cgraph]{cg_run}. The values obtained by this function for the nodes can then be supplied to argument \code{values}.

Currently, the cgraph package can only differentiate scalar target nodes. In case the value of target node \code{name} is a vector or an array, argument \code{index} can be used to specify which element of the vector or array is differentiated.

The gradients of all ancestors of the node are returned. The gradients have the same shape as the values of the nodes.

\examples{
# Initialize a computational graph
x <- cg_graph()

# Add some parameters
a <- cg_parameter(2, name = "a")
b <- cg_parameter(4, name = "b")

# Perform some operations on the parameters
c <- cg_sin(a) + cg_cos(b) - cg_tan(a)

# Differentiate the graph with respect to c.
grads <- cg_gradients(c, cg_run(c))

# Retrieve the gradient of c with respect to a
grads$a
