\title{Computational Graph}
\value{
cgraph object.
}
\description{
Initialize a new computational graph.
}
\details{
\code{$new()}
}
\note{
The cgraph object is set to be the active graph. Any nodes that are created by wrapper function \code{const}, \code{input}, or \code{parm} will be added to this graph unless the active graph is changed. You can change the current graph by calling the \code{$active()} method on another cgraph object.
