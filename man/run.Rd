\title{Evaluate the Graph}
\usage{
run(name, values = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{character scalar or symbol, name of the node that is evaluated.}

\item{values}{named list or environment, values that are subsituted for the nodes in the graph.}
}
\value{
environment, the value of node \code{name} including the values of all ancestors of \code{name}.
}
\description{
Evaluate node \code{name} in the active graph.
}
\note{
All nodes required to compute node \code{name} must have a value or their value must be able to be computed at run-time. Nodes can be assigned a value when they are created. Alternatively, argument \code{values} can be used to substitute values for nodes that do not have a value (e.g. inputs) or to fix their values.

Only those nodes needed to compute node \code{name} are evaluated and their values are returned. Values of nodes that have not changed or are not evaluated are not returned.
