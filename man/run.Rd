\title{Evaluate a Graph}
\value{
cg.results object, the value of node \code{name} including the values of all ancestors of node \code{name} that are evaluated in the forward-pass.
}
\description{
Evaluate node \code{name} in the graph.
}
\note{
All placeholders required to compute node \code{name} must have a value. Placeholders can be assigned a default value when they are created. Alternatively, argument \code{values} can be used to substitute values for placeholders that do not have a default value or to fix the values of nodes.

In case the return value of an expression has no \code{dim} attribute attached to it, the attribute is automatically attached. The only exception to this rule is if the expression casts the results explicitly to a numeric vector by function \code{c}.

Only those nodes needed to compute node \code{name} are evaluated and their values are returned. The values of placeholders whose default values are not changed are not returned.
