#' Change Active Graph
#'
#' Set a graph to be the active graph.

#' @param graph cg_graph object, the graph that is activated.
#'
#' @note Any nodes that are created are automatically added to the active graph. This also applies to operations that are created by overloaded S3 functions that do not follow the cg_<name> naming convention (such as primitive inflix functions '+' and '-').
#'
#' Only one graph can be active at a time. The active graph can be changed by calling this function on another cg_graph object.
