cgraph 2.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

Comments:

* The license of the package has changed from GPL-3 to Apache License 2.0.

Features:

* Added hyperbolic trigonometry operations `sinh` and `cosh`.
* Added inverse hyperbolic trigonometry operations `asinh` and `acosh`.
* The elements of member `nodes` of a `cgraph` object are now named for more convenient access to the symbols of the nodes in a graph.
* You can now instruct the active graph to no longer automatically evaluate a node when it is printed to the console by setting `options(cg.autorun = FALSE)`.

Bug Fixes:

* Improved error handling. Functions now raise an error when an invalid object is provided instead of trying to coerce the object to a valid object.
* Function `run` now checks whether each node evaluates to a numeric vector or array.
* Function `gradients` now checks whether the node supplied to argument `name` evaluates to a numeric vector or array. 
* Function `address` now correctly shows the address of an pointer on Windows machines.
* Function `get.parms` and `add.parms` now correctly call the underlying C-code.

cgraph 1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

Comments:

* CRAN Review on the cgraph 1.0.0 submission.

Documentation:

* Added RGraphviz to suggests.
* Added examples to the documentation of the most important methods of a `cgraph` object and their corresponding wrapper functions.

Bug Fixes:

* Function `address` now correctly calls the underlying C-code.
